# Reflective-Ethical Engine (REE)

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.17859684.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17859684)

A minimal cognitive architecture unifying perception, action, planning, and conscious experience through trajectory selection in a fused predictive latent manifold.

## Overview

REE comprises three functional components:
- **E1:** Deep recurrent predictor (long-horizon world model)
- **E2:** Fast feedforward predictor (immediate sensory grounding)
- **E3:** Trajectory selector (generates perception and action)

The architecture provides unified mechanistic accounts of psychiatric phenomena as failures in prediction maintenance, latent geometry, and trajectory selection.

## Key Contributions

1. **Dual-timescale predictive fusion** into single temporally-displaced manifold
2. **L-space as prediction-depth continuum** (not discrete layers)
3. **Trajectory selection as consciousness mechanism** (E3 defines experience)
4. **Temporal realignment** in action decoding (delay compensation)
5. **Unified perception-action substrate** (no separate modules)
6. **Computational psychiatry via manifold geometry** (symptoms as distortions)
7. **Minimal substrate-independent AGI architecture**

## Implementation Status

🚧 **Coming soon:** Reference implementations in JAX/Flax and PyTorch
